Linear Discriminant Analysis or Normal Discriminant Analysis or Discriminant Function Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that is commonly used for supervised classification problems. 
It is used for modelling differences in groups i.e. separating two or more classes


What is the difference between K clustering and LDA?

K-means, known for its simplicity and speed, boasted that it could group any collection of documents in a flash. LDA, on the other hand, was confident in its ability to uncover the latent topics hidden within the data using probabilistic generative modeling.


Is linear discriminant analysis LDA supervised or unsupervised?

Both PCA and LDA are linear transformation techniques used for dimensionality reduction. However, PCA is unsupervised and LDA is a supervised one with the fact that the dependent variable (DV) is considered makes LDA a supervised model.


Is LDA a form of clustering?

LDA does not have a distance metric.
Unlike typical clustering algorithms like K-Means, it does not assume any distance measure between topics. Instead it infers topics purely based on word counts, based on the bag-of-words representation of documents


Can LDA be used for clustering?

Strictly speaking, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is not a clustering algorithm. 
This is because clustering algorithms produce one grouping per item being clustered, whereas LDA produces a distribution of groupings over the items being clustered. Consider k-means, for instance, a popular clustering algorithm.
